# Escape From Transylvania
**Escape from Transylvania** is a top-down shooter game where you have to fight with creatures from Romanian mythology, collect items, complete quests and survive in the cruel heart of Transylvania. Keep your eyes on the countdown and find shelter in time so the poisonous gases that emerge from the soil don't drain the life out of you. <br><br>
